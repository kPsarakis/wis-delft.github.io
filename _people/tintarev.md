## About
I am a Full Professor in Explainable AI at Maastricht University, and a visiting Professor at TU Delft.
I am the PI of the Epsilon lab, where I lead and contribute to several projects in the field of human-computer interaction in artifical advice giving systems, such as recommender systems; specifically developing the state-of-the-art for automatically generated explanations (transparency) and explanation interfaces (recourse and control). These include projects funded by IBM, and Twitter, as well as a EU Marie-Curie ITN on Interactive Natural Language Technology for Explainable Artificial Intelligence. In addition, I collaborate with a number of private and public organizations such as Inspectie Leefomgeving en Transport (ILT), CGI/Prorail, Capgemini/Unilever, Porsche, Blendle, PersGroep, and FDMedia. I regularly shape international scientific research programs (e.g., on steering committees of journals, or as program chair of conferences), and actively organize and contribute to high level strategic workshops relating to responsible data science, both in the Netherlands and internationallty. I am a senior member of the ACM since 2020.
